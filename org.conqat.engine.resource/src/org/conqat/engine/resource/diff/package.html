<body>
	The processors in this package support the diffing of scopes. We
	compare a
	<i>main</i> resource tree (which is typically the development trunk of
	the versioning system) with a
	<i>comparee</i> (which is typically some older snapshot).
	
	TODO: I see some issues with this package:
	<ul>
	<li>The overall architecture, particularly the connection between ScopeDiffer and ScopeDiffInfo, is not entirely clear to me. 
	We have some processors that behave baseline-style, others work on the ScopeDiffInfo and are mainly concerned with copying
	stuff around.
	<li>There is no explicit enum for the modification types (added, modified, ...) which makes the code redundant and inconsistent
	<li>We appear to be in the middle of an unfinished review cycle with multiple contributors...
	</ul>
