<body>
The resource bundle provides an abstraction layer to content providing
resources. They are represented using ConQAT nodes, where inner nodes
(elements without content) are represented by
<em>containers</em>, while content carrying nodes are called
<em>element</em>. The actual access to the content is described by content 
accessors.
