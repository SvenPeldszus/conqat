This bundle deals with hierarchical graphs, which are just like the
usual graphs consisting of nodes (or vertices) and (directed) edges
between them, but the nodes are structured using a hierarchy (i.e. a
tree with the nodes as leaves). Besides processors for creating these
graphs, there is a multitude of processors for filtering, clustering and
labeling these graphs ranging from something simple as clustering
connected components to advanced operations such as calculating the
PageRank for the nodes of the graph.
