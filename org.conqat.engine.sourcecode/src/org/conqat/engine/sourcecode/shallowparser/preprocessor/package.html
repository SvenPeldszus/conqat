<body>This package provides preprocessors that can be used to
	deal with dialects of certain languages. The idea is to first allow a
	preprocessor to normalize the token stream, which then can be processed
	by the parser. Despite the name, this is not related to the C
	preprocessor, although the ConQAT preprocessor is often used to solve
	problems with C preprocessor macros.
