<body>

This packages defines ConQAT's logging facility. This facility was introduced
to enable processor-level logging. This allows to trace a logging event to the
processor that generated it.
<p>
To achieve this, a the new logging interface 
{@link org.conqat.engine.core.logging.IConQATLogger} was introduced. An instance
of this interface is provided to every processor via 
{@link  org.conqat.engine.core.core.IConQATProcessorInfo#getLogger()}.
ConQAT processors should exclusively use this interface for logging. A direct
access to Log4J loggers is discouraged.
