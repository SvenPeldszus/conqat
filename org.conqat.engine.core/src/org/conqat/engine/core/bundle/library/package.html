<p>This package provides a mechanism to describe one or multiple Java libraries
textual by library descriptors. Library descriptors hold the library name, version
and license. A library can consist of multiple jar files. The link between library
descriptor files and jar files is based on file names. I.e.
<code>my-library.lib</code> will cover all jar files with a name matching
<code>my-library(.*).jar</code>.</p>
<p>The library descriptors are used for license compliance checks as well as
automatically generating a NOTICE file.</p>
