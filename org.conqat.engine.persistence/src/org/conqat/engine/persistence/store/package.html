This package contains a generalized storage system. The idea is to have
a very simple interface onto which both more complex stores (e.g. for
index-based clone detection) and different back-end storage systems can
be mapped. The implementation is kept simple, to allow both the usage
with databases but also simple distributed key-value stores (Bigtable,
HBase, Cassandra). This also is the reason for the use of byte arrays in
the main interface, as this is the common denominator between all those
systems. The actual client code should use one of the utility classes
that can deal with more complex types.
