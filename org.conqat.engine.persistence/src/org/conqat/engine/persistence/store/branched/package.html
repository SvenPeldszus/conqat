	Implementation of stores with a branched view of history.

	<h1>General idea</h1>

	Each commit has a name and a reference to a parent commit. This can be
	used to construct arbitrarily branched commit trees. Each commit stores
	all information of keys/values created, changed, or deleted in this
	commit. To get an actual value, we then have to inspect all
	predecessors. To have suitable performance, we store (duplicate) the
	data of some of the parent commits on certain commits. This way, we do
	not have to traverse the entire parent hierarchy, but only a part of
	it. In the implementation, thus each commit also has a delta
	predecessor. This it the (grand) parent up to which the commit contains
	all data. So to get the actual value for some key, only the delta
	predecessor and its delta predecessors have to be checked. A commit
	with a delta predecessors of null contains the full data.

	<h1>Deduplication</h1>

	As values are potentially stored in multiple commits, even when the
	data did not change, we implement deduplication. For this, a value is
	not stored directly, but instead a reference if created for the data.
	The reference is stored instead of the actual value in the key, and the
	actual value is stored in a separate key that can be found with the
	reference. To create references, we use the SHA-1 hash algorithm. In
	practice, SHA-1 is fast enough and has a sifficiently low collision
	probability. It is also the same technique as used in git, so this
	should be safe. Obviously, for data that is smaller than a SHA-1 hash,
	this does not save anything and so we store the data directly in this
	case.

	<h1>Managing delta predecessor links</h1>

	The critical factor about this kind of storage is how to manage the
	delta predecessor links. Being too strict with their creation will
	result in very slow data access as many predecessors have to be
	scanned. Being too lenient will result in much data being duplicated,
	increasing write times and storage requirements. The solution we use is
	that a commit node at level N (with the first commit having level 1)
	contains the data from K delta predecessors, where K is the number of
	trailing zeros in the binary representation of N. So the first commit
	contains only its own data. The second commit (10) contains also the
	data from commit 1. The 3rd commit (11) contains only its own data. The
	4th commit (100) contains data from the 3rd and 2nd commit and hence
	the full data. Commit number 6 (110) has the data from the 5th commit,
	so for performing a lookup, we have to check values in commits 6 (own
	commit) and 4 (delta parent). As 4th commit has all data, this provides
	the correct answer. A graphical example up to level 16 is given in the
	following image.

	This way, for a commit at level N we should have to look at at most
	log(N) commits. On the other hand, the storage overhead should also be
	increased by at most a log factor.
