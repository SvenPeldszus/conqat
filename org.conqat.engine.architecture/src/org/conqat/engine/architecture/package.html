    Top level package of the architecture bundle. The package provides the
    infrastructure for assessing an architecture definition based on
    dependencies extracted from a given scope.
  </p>
  <p>
    The central architecture analysis requires an <em>architecture
    definition</em>, the <em>scope</em> containing the relevant elements, and
    the <em>dependencies</em> between these elements. Which dependencies are
    considered depends on the respective application. Therefore, this package
    does <em>not</em> provide processors to extract these. To get an idea of how
    this is done, have a look at the <code>ImportListBuilder</code> in the Java
    package for example.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Among the important processors is the <b>ArchitectureDefinitionReader</b>,
    which reads an architecture stored in an XML file. The
    <b>DependenciesExtractor</b> takes a scope and collects all findings which
    represent dependencies from it. In addition, it also looks for dependencies
    stored in string format ("a -> b") and creates artificial findings for them.
    All findings are returned as a finding report. This finding report (which
    represents the dependencies) together with the architecture definition and
    the scope from which the dependencies were extracted are passed to the
    <b>ArchitectureAnalyzer</b>, which performs the assessment of the
    architecture. The result is returned as an <b>AnnotatedArchitecture</b>,
    which can&mdash;for example&mdash;be visualized using the
    <b>ArchitectureLayouter</b>. The block <b>ArchitectureAnalysis</b> combines
    all these steps and provides a default architecture analysis.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <em>Just a note on the rationale for using findings for storing
    dependencies.</em> It started from parser-based dependency analysis (as we
    now use it for C/C++), which can provide much more detailed dependencies
    than the byte-code analysis (at least the constant pool approach we use for
    Java). Especially when trying to understand, whether a dependency actually
    exists or is a problem at all, I need the information what kind of
    dependency it is (for C/C++ we currently have 3 different kinds) and where
    it is located in the source code (which is not so easy as with Java and its
    imports). So I needed location and category information for dependencies,
    which sounded a lot like findings to me. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Additionally, it seems plausible to have architecture violations annotated
    as findings in the code. When dependencies are findings, this is just a
    matter of filtering/removing allowed dependencies. No further conversion is
    needed.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Thus it seems better, to work with findings all along (also because we now
    have good support in ConQAT for filtering, etc.) and not introduce a new
    kind of entity (dependency). The simple string lists are not sufficient any
    more.
