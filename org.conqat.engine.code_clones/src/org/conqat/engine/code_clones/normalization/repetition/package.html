Detects repetitions of simple motifs in source code.
Using more conservative token normalization in regions of repetitive code
can be used to increase precision of clone detection.
<p>
Chains of variable declarations or constant definitions and sequences of getters or setters 
in source code typically only differ in their identifiers and are else structurally similar. 
If identifiers are normalized, such code regions appear to be equal to the clone detection 
algorithm and are thus identified as clones. However, such clones are typically only 
interesting to the developer, if the contained code pieces share more similarity than structure alone.
In such cases it is thus more advisable to use a more conservative normalization that 
preserves identifiers. Since application of conservative normalization on an entire project 
can lead to loss of recall, such regions need to be identified. 
<p>
This package implements a generic algorithm to identify regions of repetitive code that can be used 
for context-sensitive normalization. The basic intuition is that chains of variable deteclarations, 
getters, setters, constant definitions, ... have in common that on a syntax level, they can be 
understood of consecutive repetitions of a fixed-length number of statements, the so called motif.
This package implements an algorithm to detect such motif repetitions in source code.
<p>
Terms: The <b>sequence</b> of characters "xxx12312313xxx" contains the
<b>repetition</b> "123123123" at index 3 with <b>motif</b> "123".
