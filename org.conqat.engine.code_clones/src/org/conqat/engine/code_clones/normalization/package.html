<p>A normalization component normalizes the input to simplify
detection. Additionally, it performs transformations on the input that
remove potential small differences between code fragments. This way,
clone detection gets robust against certain types of changes. For
example, token based normalization can remove comments from the input.
Thus, code snipets that differ in their comments and are equal otherwise
are detected as clones.</p>

<p>This package contains different normalizations that offer a trade
off between normalization expressiveness and required knowledge of the
language being analyzed. Line and word based normalizations require
little knowledge about the language being analyzed from the clone
detective. However, they also offer limited normalization capabilities.
Token based normalizations require more knowledge about the language
being analyzed (in form of a scanner for that language) but in return
use the additional information to provide better normalization.</p>
<p>Use the token based normalizations if a scanner for your language
is available. Use line or word based normalization if there isn't, and
you don't want to implement your own scanner.</p>

<p>In case you implement your own scanner for a new language, please
consider to donate it to the clone detective project, so that we can
include it in a future release. See {@link
org.conqat.engine.code_clones.normalization.string.LineNormalization},
