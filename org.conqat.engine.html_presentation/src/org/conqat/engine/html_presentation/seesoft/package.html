Processors and accompanying classes for visualizing source code in SeeSoft-like
views. Individual files are rendered as rectangles with each character
represented by one pixel, optionally leaving out characters from the source
file. The rectangles can also use a color attached to the IConQATNode and
findings can be highlighted.
