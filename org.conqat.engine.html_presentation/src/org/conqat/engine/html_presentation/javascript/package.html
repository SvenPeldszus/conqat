	<p>This package and the sub packages provide the core of the
		JavaScript integration for ConQAT. It utilizes many ideas from
		Google's closure tools (http://code.google.com/intl/de-DE/closure/).
		Thus, for better understanding, reading the book "Closure: The
		Definitve Guide" by M. Bolin may be a good idea.</p>

	<h1>Overview</h1>

	<p>JavaScript is used primarily for interactive pages in the HTML
		dashboard and for providing web applications for ConQAT services.
		During development, the JavaScript code is distributed over multiple
		JavaScript files. In the output (for the web browser), the code is
		integrated into a single file, both to reduce the number of JavaScript
		files and also to allow better compression of the code.</p>

	<h1>Organization of JavaScript Code</h1>

	<p>For custom (hand-written) code, we follow the style of Google's
		closure tools (http://code.google.com/intl/de-DE/closure/). This
		includes a programming style with classes and idioms that are similar
		to Java code, heavy usage of JSDoc (including type annotations), and
		explicit dependencies provided via "goog.provide" and "goog.require".</p>
	<p>The custom code is placed in the main source folder ("src"),
		while third-party JavaScript code (that is not reviewed) is placed in
		"class-resources". JavaScript in both locations will ultimately end up
		in the "classes" directory of the bundle.</p>
	<p>The integration between JavaScript and Java code is performed
		via JavaScript modules. These are Java classes that act as a wrapper
		around a set of JavaScript files. They are used to locate and load
		(typically from the classpath) the JavaScript files, and also contain
		utility methods for using the JavaScript code from Java.</p>
	<p>The JavaScript code may also include closure templates (*.soy).
		These are automatically compiled to JavaScript in the
		assembly/compilation step explained below.</p>

	<h1>Assembly and Compilation of JavaScript</h1>

	<p>The main JavaScript file is created and compiled the first time
		it is accessed (for example when executing the HTMLPresentation). If
		the file is accessed multiple times during one ConQAT run, a cached
		version of the file is reused.</p>
	<p>The first step is the assembly of the JavaScript. For this, all
		JavaScript modules are inspected and the code retrieved. The list of
		all modules is managed in the JavaScriptManager; registration of
		modules must happen beforehand, e.g. in the BundleContext of a bundle.
		All JavaScript code that is provided manually, is included. For
		third-party code, only code that is (transitively) referenced from
		custom code is included. This helps to keep the size of the JavaScript
		low, even when using large libraries, such as Google's closure
		library. To find the required code, the JavaScript module provides
		dependencies for the JavaScript files. These are either explicit
		library dependencies, or dependencies extracted from the JavaScript
		code ("goog.require", "goog.provide").</p>
	<p>Compilation of the JavaScript is performed via Google's closure
		compiler (although this can be deactivated). The results/issues of the
		compilation are reported in the log for the processors that first
		accessed the JavaScript file and hence triggered compilation.</p>
	<p>For development, there is a StandaloneJavaScriptCompiler class,
		that can be used to start compilation without executing ConQAT. As
		this is a ConQAT runnable, this has to be executed via the
		ConQATRunner program.</p>
	<p>Depending on the amount of code, compilation of the script can
		take a couple of minutes. As this is a significant overhead when not
		developing the JavaScript code, the results of the compilation are
		cached on disk. For this, the "js-cache" directory in the "resources"
		directory is used. If the JavaScript code and compiler settings did
		not change (and checked via a check sum), this cached script is reused
		rather that performing a recompile. This directory may also contain a
		"compile.properties" file, that can be used to set various compilation
		options that may be useful during development. A template for this
		file is provided.</p>

	<h1>Closure Templates (aka Soy)</h1>

	<p>For generating larger chunks of HTML from a script, we use
		closure templates, also known as Soy. Soy code is integrated and
		treated just as JavaScript code, with the difference that during the
		assembly, the Soy templates are transparently compiled to JavaScript.
		From this stage on, only the JavaScript code is kept (the Soy code is
		no longer relevant).</p>
	<p>As a rule of thumb, a Soy template should be used if the HTML to
		be created is longer that a single line or contains complex
		interleaving with content (variables) from the remaining script. A
		typical example is the generation of HTML tables from JavaScript
		arrays.</p>
