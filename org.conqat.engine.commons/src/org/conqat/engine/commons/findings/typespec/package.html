<body>
Classes for adding structural information to finding groups (kind of
type specification). This formatting information contains the names of
relevant keys as well as a type for the values of this key. This
information can for example be used in cq.inspect for displaying
additional columns in the findings group view. The group is the right
place to store this information, as a group is usually controlled by
exactly one processor, while there might be multiple processors adding
to a category; findings themselves are too fine granular.
