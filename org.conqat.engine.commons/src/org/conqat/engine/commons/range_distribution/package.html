This package defines "Range Distributions". Range distributions are a straightforward but powerful mechanism
to aggregate file-level metrics to the system level.

Additionally, assessment rules may be defined to define system level assessments, e.g. only 30% of the code 
(measured by LOC) may be "RED", i.e. in a arange defined in the range distribution.
